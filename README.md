TM602X
======


Description
-----------

Simple application to generate the login "password of the day" for the Arris TM602X telephony modem family.


Dependencies
------------

Boost Date Time library for specific date handling.


Building
--------

Requires a decent C++11 compiler (e.g. clang-3.1 with libc++, or g++-4.7 with stdlibc++).  

    export CXX="g++-4.7" CXXFLAGS="-std=c++11"
    make


Usage
-----

For the password of the day, just run:

    ./tm602x-key

Generate keys for a specific time period:

    ./tm602x-key -week
    ./tm602x-key -month
    ./tm602x-key -year

For reasons of simple environment integration, the output is formatted as:

    <ISO 8601> <key>

    2013-1-13 XXXXXXXXXX

If you want to generate passwords for other days, you have two simple options:

* pass a specific boost::gregorian::date to the constructor
* use boost::gregorian::from_string() to parse your input
