TM602X
======

Simple library / application to generate the login "password of the day" for the Arris TM602X telephony modem family.


Requires a decent C++11 compiler (e.g. clang-3.1 with libc++).


This is a simple command line application; for the original Javascript version by Ra√∫l Pedro Santos see:
